# Large Scale Data Mining

This repository contains six projects for EE219 Large-Scale Data Mining: Models and Algorithms at UCLA.

### 1. 20 Newsgroups

In this project, we work with "20 Newsgroups" dataset. It is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned evenly across 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. We used Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for dimension reduction, and implemented machine learning models such as Logestic Regression, Naive Bayes and SVM to classify these newsgroups. The performance of each model is evaluated by confusion matrix, cross validation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
